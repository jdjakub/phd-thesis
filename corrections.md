# List of mandatory corrections

- Example of what makes self-sustainability worthwhile

  We discussed how the colour example is okay, but could do with another
  useful/intriguing/compelling example to motivate. Likely position in Introduction or
  earlier sections.

- Being more explicit about what BootstrapLab is and isn't.

  Some care with how this is presented. It's a means to an end not an end
  in itself.

- Relate the principles and steps towards BootstrapLab
to an existing self-sustainable system e.g., Smalltalk or Lively (Kernel/Next/4)

   This could be a section at or near the end of Chapter 4. For reference
   see for example "Back to the Future" (Ingalls et al., 1997)

- Improve citations and connection to the literature

  There is a need to better contextualise the work in the literature,
  both to acknowledge the historical work and to aid the interested reader.
  In more detail:

  * Look carefully where there are URLs and find papers instead (if possible).
    Robert and I have both commented on this within the thesis. In some cases
    you should look for an earlier paper and might like to include multiple
    citations to a concept rather than just one.

  * Figure 1.3 should use an older example, e.g., Smalltalk 80, although
    you could also use this modern example as well.

  * Thinglab and Thinglab 2 should be mentioned and compared with,
    particularly in Chapter 2 (2.2.2).

  * Related to the above, include more examples of cases of
    notational freedom (see also Smalltalk 80 examples)

  * Cite your own PPIG paper

  * Expand on Olsen.

  * In Chapter 4, hint at VMs (see Dominic's annotated copy)

  * Fix citation problems in Appendix B (some bibtex issues and \cite used
  instead of \citet)

- Generally, please add more examples or illustrations throughout.

- Modify the thesis statement, removing 'web browser'

- Expand on COLA

  Particularly in Section 2.2.2. There was insufficient detail on this
  to make the dissertation self contained.

- Explain Masp in more detail

  This should include:

   * Better explanations of the figures
   * Explaining the change in notation from JS style objects to implicit braces
   * Explaining the - and +
   * Giving a more clear relationship between Lisp and Masp.
   * An appendix giving some more details of the language (on the order of 2-5 pages)
(for example, consider the Lisp 1.5 definition).

- Where Force 1 and Force 2 are referred to, also include their names to help the
reader, not just the numbers.

- Reuse Figure 3.3 in Chapter 4 to explain BootstrapLab developments.

- Update the three properties in Appendix B so that it can be used as a complete reference

   * Also tidy / remove a few unclear/vague portions as discussed
   * Consider (optional): your 'technical dimensions' paper had a nice figure (Figure 4), why not include this here?

- Bring the other three properties back into the conclusion and eschew web browser
references (or at least recontextualise them).

- Consider carefully the annotations provided by both examiners.
