Programming is fraught with accidental complexity. Software, including tools used for programming, are inflexible and hard to adapt to one's specific problem context. Programmers thus waste cognitive effort in working around these problems. The idea of a *self-sustainable* programming system, open to adaptation by its user, promises a way out. However, the principles underlying such a property are poorly documented, as are methods for practically achieving it. We trace the causes of this difficulty and use them to inform our construction of a prototype self-sustainable system. By carefully reflecting on the steps involved in our specific case, we provide insight into how self-sustainability can be achieved in general, and thus how a motivated programmer might be able to escape some major sources of accidental complexity.

\joel{One must translate ideas into suboptimal notations, work around problems created by plain text representations, and invest disproportionate effort to remove these accidental complexities on a case-by-case basis. }
