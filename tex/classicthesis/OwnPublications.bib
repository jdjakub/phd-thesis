abstract = {There is a One-Size-Fits-All quality to languages, APIs and even programming itself. Whether you're making a mobile game or a scientific simulation, you will be using a text-based language with similar devices for structuring your code. This is a source of artificial difficulty in creating, understanding, and modifying software systems. No matter the domain, the author's design needs encoding into a form that does not resemble it. This paper describes a vision where software can be built in a programming environment that is closer to the domain of the software itself. By doing so, users of the system can use familiar abstractions and tools for adapting it. A step towards this vision is presented: a Web version of a minimal OOP system, developed as an executable version of the diagrams of its design, in a substrate meant to facilitate this. The experience of creating such a substrate is analysed, and I suggest deficiencies in programming environments that stand in the way of making this practice commonplace, as well as ways to fill in these gaps.},

abstract = {Programming is usually based on an inconvenient separation between an implementation level and a user level. Self-sustaining systems expose their implementation at their user level so that they can be modified and improved from within. However, the few examples that exist are tightly linked to textual language-based accounts of compiler bootstrapping. If we want systems to be truly open for modification, we need to step beyond programming languages and support more structured, visual ways of programming as well. How the bootstrapping process can work in such an interactive context is important yet unexplored territory. This essay is a critical report on our first-hand experience of building one such system named BootstrapLab. We trace and reconstruct the steps for achieving self-sustainability in an interactive, structured, graphical context: choose the platform; design the substrate; implement temporary infrastructure; implement a high-level language; pay off outstanding substrate debt; provide for domain-specific notations. Throughout, we discuss the challenges involved, identifying design forces that shaped the decisions and capturing heuristics that resolved these forces in our case. Both positive and negative results are featured, including the efficacy of the heuristics. We close by suggesting how to generalise what worked in our particular case to alternative paths and starting points. The enterprise as a whole takes us a further step towards achieving open and malleable programming systems for everyone.},
